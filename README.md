## Overview

Here i have cloned Naykaa Fashion Site using  HTML and CSS for styling the website and JavaScriptâ€™s DOM and localStorage.
HTML: It is used to build the basic structure of the website. All headings, Paragraphs, links, forms, etc. were structured by HTML.
JavaScript: It is used to add logical functionalities to the webpages like the onClick function, DOM, and dynamic aspects of the webpage. We used localStorage to store products and Login Details. 
I added all the functionalities.
CSS: It is used to add styling to the website. We used Advance CSS for Animation, Popup Modal window for login/Sign up, Payment, and for adding Address.


## The Challenge
I faced a lot of issues during the project. 
So, the most struggling part of the project was the slider and some of the JavaScript functionalities. Then I just decided to go model-wise and later on reached to the destination.

This has been a great experience for me to build this website. The excitement of building a certain website almost similar to the main website was unexpectedly a good thing that we had.
It is so satisfying. while building a website and merging on a GitHub to the main page. 
There are many conflicts that occur while merging the pages. But the more you do it, the better you become.
It is not just about coding, it is about problem-solving. I have always believed in learning by building the code.
